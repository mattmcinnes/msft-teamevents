# Azure Team Minecraft Mania
> An Azure Team Gaming Experience for Community Day!

## Introduction - Constraints and Creativity:

While Minecraft is an infinitely generating world with a multitude of places to explore, sometimes limitation can be a source of inspiration! For this Azure team Minecraft Mania, we'll be contained within a limited world border which can only be expanded by completing "challenges".

These "challenges" are designed to both give us something to work on together and to introduce core mechanics of the game to new players! This event is designed to be new-player friendly as each event builds on one another and requires some level of input from all players. Limiting the world size means that while in the beginning there will be fewer resources to go around, we will also have to build close by one another to encourage interaction and further the success of the team as a whole.

[!NOTE] Before you continue, please read '[JoinServer.md](./JoinServer.md)' if you haven't done so already. This will go over installing 'Minecraft' and joining the server.

## Challenges (Tier 1):

While there are multiple 'Tiers' to this event, we likely won't get too far beyond Tier 1 in the time we have allocated for this event. In any case, challenges will be "unlocked" and relayed in both 'Teams' chat and updated in this 'README' file as their prerequisite is completed. 

### Housing:
Your first challenge - build a house! Each player who completes said house which contains the listed requirements will expand the world border by 100 blocks. This allows you and your fellow teammates to explore new parts of the world and unlock more challenges!
```
To count as a 'House', a building must:
- Be an enclosed space
- Have a Door
- Have a Bed
- Have a Window
- Have walls and a roof that are NOT made of Dirt
```
```
Rewards: 
- +100 Blocks to World Border (per House)
```

### Town Farm:
A community venture to feed us as we continue our exploration and construction!
```
The 'Farm' must:
- Have at least 100 'farmland' blocks
- Contain 4 distinct [edible plants](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Farming)
- Chests for storing product
```
```
Rewards: 
- +200 Blocks to World Border
- Tier 2 Challenge Unlocked
```

### Town Ranch:
Wool, Eggs, Meat and lots of noise! A Ranch will open many doors... but make sure to close the barn door on your way out so we don't lose our animals! 
```
To count as a 'Ranch', a building must:
- Be an enclosed space
- Have a Double Door entryway
- Have pens for different animal species
- Have at least 3 different animal species (2 of each species)
- Have walls a roof that are NOT made of Dirt
```
```
Rewards: 
- +250 Blocks to World Border
- Tier 2 Challenge Unlocked
```

### Roads and Paths:
Minecraft's terrain can be treacherous! Let's build some paths between our buildings to connect the Town.
```
To count as a completed 'Road', a path network must:
- Be 'Walkable' (no jumping required)
- Never increase vertically more than one block at a time
- Be "paved" with Cobblestone or Gravel
- Connect to each building's main entrance
```
```
Rewards:
- +100 Blocks to World Border
- Tier 2 Challenge Unlocked
```

## Post-Event:

Once we have completed the ~90 minute 'Minecraft Mania' Event on Monday 7/25/22, the server will remain online if anyone chooses to continue playing in the future! 

The server address may change as it would be moved to either a cheaper Azure subscription and/or a home server. Idling 'Minecraft' servers consume a few Gigabytes of memory, however they are not very processor intensive until a player joins and begins rendering terrain.
