# Microsoft C&E Skilling 'Among Us' Event
> A Mary's Team Game!

## Introduction:

Hi Team! Today weâ€™ll be holding a brief team event - playing some â€˜Among Usâ€™ (organized by Willie, Julia and I)! ðŸŽ‰

In a similar vein to our â€˜Minecraftâ€™ events this is a casual team-building exercise through a free, cross-platform game.

Grab some coffee, prepare for the week, and install â€˜Among Usâ€™ on your platform of choice for a quick ~30 minute game ðŸ˜Š
