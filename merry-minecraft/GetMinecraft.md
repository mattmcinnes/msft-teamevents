## Apply your key to a personal Microsoft account

Xbox logins are blocked for our main FTE accounts, so you'll have to login using a personal Microsoft account. If you don't want to use your primary personal account, [create a new Microsoft account here](https://account.microsoft.com/account)

1. Go to Minecraft.net's [Redeem Code Site](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/redeem-code). Paste the 'Xbox Game Pass Ultimate' code from earlier and click 'Next'
